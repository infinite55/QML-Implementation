# QML-Implementation
Winter in Data Science Project-2022, Analytics Club, IIT Bombay

Mentors: Aditya Sriram, Siddhant Midha

### Overview
This project aimed to explore the implementation of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) using Qiskit and Pennylane. The project started with a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of Quantum Computing and the algorithms involved. This was followed by hands-on implementation of the algorithms using Qiskit, a popular open-source framework for quantum computing.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to QML, with an emphasis on gaining a solid understanding of the concepts through reading articles and papers. The knowledge acquired was then put into practice by implementing classical and quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on Pennylane, a quantum machine learning library.

Finally, the project culminated in the preparation of a detailed report that provided an in-depth overview of the journey, highlighting lessons learned and the results of the experiments. The report also provided insights into the strengths and limitations of QGANs (GANs in general) and its potential for real-world applications.

In conclusion, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive and hands-on experience in the implementation of QML, highlighting the importance of quantum computing in the field of machine learning.
